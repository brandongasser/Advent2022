# Advent of Code 2022

These are my solutions for [Advent of Code 2022](https://adventofcode.com/2022).
My solutions are written in [Haskell](https://www.haskell.org/).

## Project Structure

The base directory contains any utility functions that can be used between days.
The solutions for each day are in a folder named "dayx".
Each folder contains my puzzle input in a text file "input.txt" and any haskell files used for the puzzle.

## Running a Solution

To run a solution, run the following command from the base directory
```
runhaskell day[day number]/[file name]
```
